## About the Project
This project is part of the Project Based Internship (PBI) organized by Kimia Farma x Rakamin Academy. As a Big Data Analytics Intern at Kimia Farma, the tasks given to me include a series of jobs that require a deep understanding of data and analytical skills. One of the main projects given is to evaluate Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023. In addition, I was also assigned to create a dashboard of Kimia Farma's product sales data from the available raw data.

Details of the work can be seen in the presentation file "Kimia Farma_Big Data Analytics" in this repository.
